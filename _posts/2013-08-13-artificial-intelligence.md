## Class Information

* Instructor: Muhammad Rahman
* Office Location: UC 337
* Course Number: CSCI 4307
* Class Times: Tues. & Thurs. 12:45PM-2:00PM
* Textbook: Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_, 3rd Edition, &copy;2010 ISBN-13: 9780136042594

## Course objectives and Learning outcomes

Students are expected to achieve developing level of mastery of topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning. At the conclusion of this course, the successful (passing) students will be able to:

* Formulate an efficient problem space for a problem expressed in English by expressing that problem space in terms of states, operators, an initial state, and a description of a goal state.
* Explain how an agent differs from other categories of intelligent systems.
* Compare and contrast common models for structured knowledge representation.
* Explain various search techniques and apply advanced search techniques to classic problem domains.
* Develop grammar and identify the classic parsing algorithms for parsing natural language.
* Explain need for established corpus with examples of catalog and look up procedures in corpus-based approach. implement a simple learning system using decision trees, neural networks and/or belief networks.
* Explain nearest neighbor algorithm and other machine learning techniques to problem domain.
* Implement strategies for navigation of robots with aid of landmarks and sensors.
* Articulate the techniques for information retrieval.

## What is AI?

The main definitions of AI consist of _thought processes_, _reasoning_, and _behavior_. The following are some definitions of aritificial intelligence, organized into four categories.

![Thinking](http://caseyscarborough.github.io/class-notes/images/artificial-intelligence-20130813-1.png)

#### Thinking Humanly

* The automation of activities that we associate with human thinking, such as decision making, problem solving, and learning.

#### Acting Humanly

* Creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people.
* The study of how to make computers do things at which people are better, such as playing chess.

#### Thinking Rationally

* The study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act.

#### Acting Rationally

* The study of the design of intelligent agents.

## Foundations of AI

The following are disciplines that contributed ideas, viewpoints, and techniques to AI.

#### Philosophy

* Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?
* How does the mind arise from a physical brain?
* Where does knowledge come from?
* How does knowledge lead to action?

#### Mathematics

* What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?
* What can be computed?
* How do we reason with uncertain information?

#### Economics

* How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff?
* How should we do this when others may not go along?
* How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?

#### Neuroscience

* How do brains process information?

#### Psychology

* How do humans and animals think and act?

#### Computer engineering

* How can we build an efficient computer?

#### Control theory and cybernetics

* How can artifacts operate under their own control?

#### Linguistics

* How does language relate to thought?
