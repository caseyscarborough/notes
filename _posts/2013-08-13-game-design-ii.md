## XNA Game Studio

We will be using XNA Game Studio 4.0 all semester, even though it is discontinued.

Apparently it doesn't work on Windows 8 by default, so here are some helpful links:

## Computers and Programs

* A program is a list of instructions that tell a computer what to do.
* When you write a program, you have to do two things:
  * Figure out how to solve the problem.
  * Express your solution in a form the computer can understand.
* If you can't do it, neither can the computer.

## Three Things To Learn

* The C# programming language &#10004;
  * Used to tell the computer what to do.
* The XNA game development framework
  * A set of resources to help you make games.
* Visual Studio &#10004;
  * A tool used to create, run, and debug programs.

## Running Your First Game Program

* A game contains lots of _content_. This is the stuff that is not program code:
  * graphics, sound, level designs, cscripts, help text
* This must all be managed as part of the game so that when it is sent to the Xbox 360 it is all available for use.
* XNA Game Studio provides a _Content Manager_ to look after this.

## To Do

* Have XNA up and running before next class.
