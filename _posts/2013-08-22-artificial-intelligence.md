# Chapter 3: Solving Problems by Searching

This chapter describes one kind of goal-based agent called a __problem solving agent__. Problem solving agents use __atomic__ representations, that is, states of the world are considered as wholes, with no internal structure visible to the problem-solving algorthms.

We describe several general-purpose search algorithms that can be used to solve these problems.

* __Uninformed search algorithms__
  * Algorithms athat are given no information about the problem other than its definition.
  * Some of these algorithms can solve any solvable problem, but none are efficient.
* __Informed search algorithms__
  * Do quite wll give some guidance on where to look for solutions.

__Problem formulation__ is the process of deciding what actions and states to consider, given a goal. _Don't make things too complex!_ Bringing too much detail into the problem can cause unneeded complexity.

#### I hate taking notes in this class. Rahman reads straight out of the book. So read Chapter 3!
